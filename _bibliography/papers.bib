  abstract = {Learning from mistakes is an effective learning approach widely used in human learning, where a learner pays greater focus on mistakes to circumvent them in the future to improve the overall learning outcomes. In this work, we aim to investigate how effectively we can leverage this exceptional learning ability to improve machine learning models. We propose a simple and effective multi-level optimization framework called learning from mistakes using class weighting (LFM-CW), inspired by mistake-driven learning to train better machine learning models. In this formulation, the primary objective is to train a model to perform effectively on target tasks by using a re-weighting technique. We learn the class weights by minimizing the validation loss of the model and re-train the model with the synthetic data from the image generator weighted by class-wise performance and real data. We apply our LFM-CW framework with differential architecture search methods on image classification datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where the results show that our proposed strategy achieves lower error rate than the baselines.},

  abstract  = {Machines cannot outperform human intelligence yet; however, an image-based dialog can enable machines to perceive cues from different modalities and process information in a more human-like manner. The proposed solution is an AI-based agent that can have engaging conversations with humans by considering an image and answering questions about its visual content, taking into account both visual and textual context. Deep learning-based techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with self-attention mechanisms have been employed. Responses generated by such models, in some cases, are more biased towards dialog history and are not very relevant to the actual question asked. The proposed work focuses on reducing the modality biases without compromising dialog history and improving the visual context through the use of dense captions to describe various entities in the image and generate relevant answers.},

  abstract  = {The world is advancing towards an autonomous environment at a great pace and it has become a need of an hour, especially during the current pandemic situation. The pandemic has hindered the functioning of many sectors, one of them being Road development and maintenance. Creating a safe working environment for workers is a major concern of road maintenance during such difficult times. This can be achieved to some extent with the help of an autonomous system that will aim at reducing human dependency. In this paper, one of such systems, a pothole detection and dimension estimation, is proposed. The proposed system uses a Deep Learning based algorithm YOLO (You Only Look Once) for pothole detection. Further, an image processing based triangular similarity measure is used for pothole dimension estimation. The proposed system provides reasonably accurate results of both pothole detection and dimension estimation. The proposed system also helps in reducing the time required for road maintenance. The system uses a custom made dataset consisting of images of water-logged and dry potholes of various shapes and sizes.},

  abstract  = {There is always a significant amount of challenges associated with waste and its disposal, which can be essentially mitigated by the use of technology. As the urban population increases, the amount of waste disposal is also increasing at an unprecedented rate. The inappropriate disposal of this waste will lead to many hazards including the risk of fires in the dump yards that leverages poisonous smoke in the atmosphere by adversely affecting the safety of nearby residential areas. Monitoring the occurrence of fire in huge dumping grounds manually is a tough task and thus developing an automatic fire extinguishing system is highly required. The advanced technologies can be leveraged to ensure the protection and safety of people by eliminating such hazardous risks. The air quality index (AQI) is an indicator of daily air quality report that shows how air quality affects a person's life in a very short time. AQI plays a key role in ensuring the safety of residential areas. The proposed system aims to aid the possible hazardous risks associated with the dump yard and waste management.},

  abstract  = {There are a plethora of problems associated with agriculture and farming which require considerable improvements but remain untouched by technology. Farming is considered as one of the strong pillars of any economy. Considering this, very few technologies exist to aid the farmers in selecting the right crops depending on the environmental factors. Moreover most irrigation systems all around the world require at least some form of human intervention. Considering this, the proposed smart farming solution aims to aid the farmers by means of technology so as to increase their yield by suggesting to them the crops that will be most profitable for them as well as automating the irrigation system for them. This in turn will be a major help to the agriculture community as a whole and also set free the farmers from certain rudimentary tasks.},
