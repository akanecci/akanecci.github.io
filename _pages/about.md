Hello, I am Akane Dabre and I am here to help you achieve your dream of learning Japanese. I am a certified Japanese teacher and have received my certification from KEC, Japan. If you are someone who is interested in Japan, planning to live in Japan, or just want to learn Japanese then you can avail my services. I provide flexible learning courses tailor made for your specific requirements. 

Before starting my journey of becoming a Japanese teacher, I worked as an administrative specialist at Nippon Steel, Japan where I was responsible for managing the workflows for steel products. Prior to that, I was a student at Ritsumeikan University, Japan, where I got my degree in English Literature. My hobbies are language learning, flamenco dancing, drawing, music, playing the guitar and traveling. I speak Japanese fluently and conversational level English and Spanish. I also speak basic Marathi.

If you are interested in my course then email me at [neccijpn@gmail.com](neccijpn@gmail.com).
