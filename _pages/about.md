Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am an AI Resident at [AI4Bharat (IIT Madras)](https://ai4bharat.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/), [Dr. Anoop Kunchukuttan](http://anoopk.in/) and [Dr. Raj Dabre](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=x91u618AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), working on building open-source datasets and models for Indian languages. I am broadly interested in the areas of multimodal and multilingual learning, specifically in the context of data-efficient learning, training dynamics and generalization.

I am also collaborating with [Dr. Zeerak Talat](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3M3WdvkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) from [Simon Fraser University](https://digitaldemocracies.org/) on hate speech detection using federated learning. Prior to that I was a research intern at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008), where I worked on neural architecture search and generative models.

I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Mumbai](https://www.djsce.ac.in/), India. In the past, I was a machine learning intern at [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/), where I worked on understanding customer behavior using natural language processing. Before that, I also collaborated with Prof. Pratik Kanani on an industry project focusing on anomaly detection in heart rate (pulse) using IoT and machine learning.

I serve as a mentor at [DJ Unicode](https://www.djunicode.in/), a student organization that aims to aspire sophomores and juniors to contribute to open-source projects. I also led a team that developed a platform for conducting C programming examination in the college for over 500 students ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn7lwJoYfuU)).

I also co-founded the research division of Unicode (a.k.a. [Unicode Research](https://unicode-research.netlify.app/people/)) jointly with [Swapneel Mehta](https://swapneelm.github.io/) from [NYU CSMaP group](https://csmapnyu.org/), where we were fortunate to be joined by [Dr. Akash Srivastava](https://akashgit.github.io/) from [MIT-IBM AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) for foundational lectures on deep generative models and probabilistic machine learning. I was a teaching Assistant for the [Unicode Machine Learning Summer Course 2021](https://djunicode.github.io/umlsc-2021/) supported by **Google Research India**. We are currently working on estimating the causal effect of non-expert mentorship on student career outcomes and social network analysis using probabilistic machine learning to understand opinion polarization and spread of disinformation in online communities.
