I sense a soul in search of an answer!  

I am a Researcher at [National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)](https://astrec.nict.go.jp/en/), under the direction of [Masao Utiyama](https://att-astrec.nict.go.jp/member/mutiyama/index.html), and an Adjunct Faculty in IIT Madras, working alongside [Prof Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) and [Dr Anoop Kunchukuttan](http://anoopk.in/) of [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.org/). I am also a visiting researcher at [CFILT](https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/) which is headed by [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/). I work on efficient multilingual understanding and generation for low-resource languages, especially Indic and Creole languages.

I completed my Ph.D. in Informatics from Kyoto University, Japan under the supervision of [Prof. Sadao Kurohashi](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/director/) (currently director general of NII, Japan), M.Tech. in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, India under the supervision of [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) (ex-director of IIT Patna) and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Mumbai](https://www.sfit.ac.in/), India. In the past, I was an intern at Google, Japan in the Rosetta team (Google Translate) headed by [Dr. Hideto Kazawa](https://research.google/people/hideto-kazawa/).

In NICT, I focus on low-resource Machine Translation (MT) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), while working with an awesome team of international researchers. I also collaborate with Dr [Sheng Li](https://halspeech.github.io/) of the [Speech Lab in NICT](https://ast-astrec.nict.go.jp/en/). At AI4Bharat and CFILT, I am mainly involved in mentoring students on their research focusing on MT and Evaluation, NLG and, more recently, pragmatics and model robustness. Now that I am an adjunct faculty I hope to offer a course or two on Generative AI someday soon. I am one of the co-creators of [IndicBART](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indic-bart), [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2), [Airavata](https://ai4bharat.github.io/airavata/), [YANMTT](https://github.com/prajdabre/yanmtt) and [Whisper-Streaming](https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming). I also have a (Japanese) patent on [flexible decoding of generative models](https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7297286B2/ja).
